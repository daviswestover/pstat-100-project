    "     For this project we will be studying basketball statistics. The NBA has tracked statistics like points, assists, and rebounds for decades, but as we have learned how much data can help us determine value and optimization, more and more statistics have been tracked. In 2022, even things like average speed a player runs at and total distance traveled are estimated. This is because in competitive sports, any advantage that can be gained is extremely valuable. Teams like the Oakland A's have found incredible success relying on data over any collection of human opinions and biases. In this project we will use looking at individual player statistics to attempt to discern what trends correlate to better players. We are interested in finding out if taking a higher percent of 3 pointers raises your point average, or if someone's assist to turnover ratio can predict what their plus-minus (The difference between their team and the other team's points scored while a player is in the game), because if we can, it could lead to a championship."
